        <p>Meet Ashlynn Kier, our runway-ready queen with a heart of gold and a glisten that just won’t quit!

            When Ashlynn first arrived at Diva Camp™, she rolled up in pink sunglasses, a sequined tote, and the confidence of someone who already owned the catwalk. But behind those shades? She was ready for a challenge—and honey, she got it.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">💎 Diva Transformation</h1>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Before Diva Camp™: Ashlynn described herself as “more sparkle, less stamina.” She loved the glam but dreaded the gym.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">During Diva Camp™: She conquered Cardio Karaoke without missing a note, perfected her “Confidence Catwalk” lunges, and discovered that sweat really is just glitter leaving the body.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">After Diva Camp™: Ashlynn struts taller, shines brighter, and says her favorite new accessory is… toned arms. (Though she still swears by rhinestones, obviously.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">👑 Ashlynn’s Words of Wisdom</h1>
        <p>“Being a diva isn’t just about the glam—it’s about the grind. I learned that every squat is basically a curtsy to your future fabulous self. Diva Camp made me realize I don’t have to choose between glitter and grit—I can have both.”</p>
